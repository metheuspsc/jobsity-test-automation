## âœ¨ Assumptions and comments
>>#### Orders and Returns:
>>* I assumed this form is only for unlogged customers, since it returns the same data as the "My Orders" section under "My Account" 


>### Classes and Fixtures:
>>#### TestData:
>>* SimpleNamespace containing the test data, could be easily replaced by a factory to implement multiple scenarios.
>>#### Browser:
>>* This class is a high level adapter for common browser methods.
>>#### HomePage, ProductPage, RefundPage:
>>* Class for higher level test interactions with the pages. 
>>* The locators are inside the methods to simplify maintenance since there's no repetition on locators.
>### Tests:
>>#### Browser Compatibility:
>>* Tests run in Chrome and Firefox, Safari and IE could be added later since the browser setup is extandable.
